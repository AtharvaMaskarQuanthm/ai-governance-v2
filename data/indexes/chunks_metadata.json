Hardening Ubuntu Systems\n\n<!-- section_id: HP-5.4 -->\n\nHardening a Ubuntu System involves securing the system by implementing various measures to reduce its attack surface and enhance its resilience against potential threats. Here's a basic guideline for hardening steps:\n\n1. **Change time zone**\n   - **Control Statement**: It's important to ensure that you select a valid timezone identifier.\n   - **Risk/Impact**: Changing the time zone can affect the synchronization of time across various services and applications.\n\n2. **Add below lines to ~/.bash_history**\n   - **Control Statement**: The history size determines the number of commands that can be stored in the command history.\n   - **Risk/Impact**: By carefully managing the history size, you can strike a balance between usability, security, and resource efficiency.\n\n3. **Ensure that the sticky bit should be set on the below mentioned partitions.**\n   - **Control Statement**: The sticky bit is typically used on directories to control file deletion within that directory.\n   - **Risk/Impact**: It helps prevent accidental or unauthorized deletion of files within shared directories.\n\n4. **Edit the /etc/fstab file and add nodev, noexec and nosuid to the fourth field (mounting options).**\n   - **Control Statement**: This file is a critical system configuration file that contains information about filesystems and devices mounted during system boot.\n   - **Risk/Impact**: Incorrect or improper modifications to this file can lead to system boot failures or cause file system errors.\n\n5. **Check status for services:**\n   - **Control Statement**: This will provide detailed information about the service, including its current status.\n   - **Risk/Impact**: The risk and impact of checking the status of services in Ubuntu are generally low.\n\n6. **Unconfined daemon**\n   - **Control Statement**: A process running without any confinement or security restrictions imposed by a mandatory access control framework.\n   - **Risk/Impact**: It's crucial to properly assess the risks associated with unconfined daemons and take appropriate measures to confine and secure them.\n\n7. **Network Configuration and Firewalls**\n   - **Control Statement**: It's important to follow best practices, such as configuring network interfaces correctly.\n   - **Risk/Impact**: By addressing risks and implementing proper security measures, organizations can strengthen their network defenses.\n\n8. **IPv6 Networking Protocols**\n   - **Control Statement**: IPv6 is a networking protocol that supersedes IPv4.\n   - **Risk/Impact**: It is recommended that systems not accept router advertisements as they could be tricked into routing traffic to compromised machines.\n\n9. **Ensure mounting of FAT filesystems is disabled**\n   - **Control Statement**: The FAT filesystem format is primarily used on older windows systems and portable USB drives.\n   - **Risk/Impact**: Removing support for unneeded file system types reduces the local attack surface of the system.\n\n10. **Logging and Auditing**\n    - **Configure rsyslog**\n    - **Control Statement**: The rsyslog software is recommended as a replacement for the default syslogd daemon.\n    - **Risk/Impact**: The security enhancements of rsyslog justify installing and configuring the package.\n\n11. **Configure System Accounting (Optional)**\n    - **Control Statement**: System auditing, through auditd, allows system administrators to monitor their systems.\n    - **Risk/Impact**: It is important that an appropriate size is determined for log files so that they do not impact the system.\n\n12. **System Access, Authentication, and Authorization**\n    - **Restrict access to Cron**\n    - **Control Statement**: The anacron daemon is used on systems that are not up 24x7.\n    - **Risk/Impact**: Cron jobs may include critical security or administrative functions that need to run on a regular basis.\n\n13. **Configure SSH**\n    - **Control Statement**: SSH is a secure, encrypted replacement for common login services.\n    - **Risk/Impact**: It is strongly recommended that sites abandon older clear-text login protocols and use SSH.\n\n14. **Configure PAM**\n    - **Control Statement**: PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) is a service that implements modular authentication modules on UNIX systems.\n    - **Risk/Impact**: The SHA-512 algorithm provides much stronger hashing than MD5.\n\n15. **Restrict Access to the su Command**\n    - **Control Statement**: The su command allows a user to run a command or shell as another user.\n    - **Risk/Impact**: Restricting the use of su, and using sudo in its place, provides system administrators better control.\n\n16. **User Accounts and Environment**\n    - **Set Shadow Password Suite Parameters**\n    - **Control Statement**: While a majority of the password control parameters have been moved to PAM, some parameters are still available through the shadow password suite.\n    -

**Risk/Impact**: Proper planning, risk assessment, and adherence to best practices can help mitigate these risks.\n\n24. **Review User and Group Settings**\n    - **Control Statement**: This section provides guidance on securing aspects of the users and groups.\n    - **Risk/Impact**: All accounts must have passwords or be locked to prevent the account from being used by an unauthorized user.\n\n25. **Encryption**\n    - **Restrict Cipher list**\n    - **Control Statement**: Based on research conducted at various institutions, it was determined that the symmetric portion of the SSH Transport Protocol has security weaknesses.\n    - **Risk/Impact**: Data will be communicated in plain text and unauthorized users may try to perform MitM attacks.\n\n26. **Enable TLS 1.2 & Above protocol**\n    - **Control Statement**: Strong protocol ensures the message communicated between client and server must be in an encrypted way.\n    - **Risk/Impact**: Data will be communicated in plain text and unauthorized users may try to perform MitM attacks.\n\n27. **Disable weak encryption protocol**\n    - **Control Statement**: Strong protocol provides that the message communicated between client and server must be in an encrypted way.\n    - **Risk/Impact**: Data will be communicated in plain text and unauthorized users may try to perform MitM attacks.\n\n28. **Install RKhunter**\n    - **Control Statement**: Rkhunter is a shell script which carries out various checks on the local system to try and detect known rootkits and malware.\n    - **Risk/Impact**: Rootkit scanner is scanning tool to ensure you for about 99.9%* you're clean of nasty tools.\n\n29. **Ensure ptrace_scope is restricted (Automated)**\n    - **Control Statement**: The ptrace() system call provides a means by which one process may observe and control the execution of another process.\n    - **Risk/Impact**: If one application is compromised, it would be possible for an attacker to attach to other running processes.\n\n30. **Ensure core dumps are restricted (Automated)**\n    - **Control Statement**: A core dump is the memory of an executable program.\n    - **Risk/Impact**: Setting a hard limit on core dumps prevents users from overriding the soft variable.\n```",
    "content_for_embedding": "4. Hardening Ubuntu Systems\n\n\n\nHardening a Ubuntu System involves securing the system by implementing various measures to reduce its attack surface and enhance its resilience against potential threats. Here's a basic guideline for hardening steps:\n\n1. **Change time zone**\n   - **Control Statement**: It's important to ensure that you select a valid timezone identifier.\n   - **Risk/Impact**: Changing the time zone can affect the synchronization of time across various services and applications.\n\n2. **Add below lines to ~/.bash_history**\n   - **Control Statement**: The history size determines the number of commands that can be stored in the command history.\n   - **Risk/Impact**: By carefully managing the history size, you can strike a balance between usability, security, and resource efficiency.\n\n3. **Ensure that the sticky bit should be set on the below mentioned partitions.**\n   - **Control Statement**: The sticky bit is typically used on directories to control file deletion within that directory.\n   - **Risk/Impact**: It helps prevent accidental or unauthorized deletion of files within shared directories.\n\n4. **Edit the /etc/fstab file and add nodev, noexec and nosuid to the fourth field (mounting options).**\n   - **Control Statement**: This file is a critical system configuration file that contains information about filesystems and devices mounted during system boot.\n   - **Risk/Impact**: Incorrect or improper modifications to this file can lead to system boot failures or cause file system errors.\n\n5. **Check status for services:**\n   - **Control Statement**: This will provide detailed information about the service, including its current status.\n   - **Risk/Impact**: The risk and impact of checking the status of services in Ubuntu are generally low.\n\n6. **Unconfined daemon**\n   - **Control Statement**: A process running without any confinement or security restrictions imposed by a mandatory access control framework.\n   - **Risk/Impact**: It's crucial to properly assess the risks associated with unconfined daemons and take appropriate measures to confine and secure them.\n\n7. **Network Configuration and Firewalls**\n   - **Control Statement**: It's important to follow best practices, such as configuring network interfaces correctly.\n   - **Risk/Impact**: By addressing risks and implementing proper security measures, organizations can strengthen their network defenses.\n\n8. **IPv6 Networking Protocols**\n   - **Control Statement**: IPv6 is a networking protocol that supersedes IPv4.\n   - **Risk/Impact**: It is recommended that systems not accept router advertisements as they could be tricked into routing traffic to compromised machines.\n\n9. **Ensure mounting of FAT filesystems is disabled**\n   - **Control Statement**: The FAT filesystem format is primarily used on older windows systems and portable USB drives.\n   - **Risk/Impact**: Removing support for unneeded file system types reduces the local attack surface of the system.\n\n10. **Logging and Auditing**\n    - **Configure rsyslog**\n    - **Control Statement**: The rsyslog software is recommended as a replacement for the default syslogd daemon.\n    - **Risk/Impact**: The security enhancements of rsyslog justify installing and configuring the package.\n\n11. **Configure System Accounting (Optional)**\n    - **Control Statement**: System auditing, through auditd, allows system administrators to monitor their systems.\n    - **Risk/Impact**: It is important that an appropriate size is determined for log files so that they do not impact the system.\n\n12. **System Access, Authentication, and Authorization**\n    - **Restrict access to Cron**\n    - **Control Statement**: The anacron daemon is used on systems that are not up 24x7.\n    - **Risk/Impact**: Cron jobs may include critical security or administrative functions that need to run on a regular basis.\n\n13. **Configure SSH**\n    - **Control Statement**: SSH is a secure, encrypted replacement for common login services.\n    - **Risk/Impact**: It is strongly recommended that sites abandon older clear-text login protocols and use SSH.\n\n14. **Configure PAM**\n    - **Control Statement**: PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) is a service that implements modular authentication modules on UNIX systems.\n    - **Risk/Impact**: The SHA-512 algorithm provides much stronger hashing than MD5.\n\n15. **Restrict Access to the su Command**\n    - **Control Statement**: The su command allows a user to run a command or shell as another user.\n    - **Risk/Impact**: Restricting the use of su, and using sudo in its place, provides system administrators better control.\n\n16. **User Accounts and Environment**\n    - **Set Shadow Password Suite Parameters**\n    - **Control Statement**: While a majority of the password control parameters have been moved to PAM, some parameters are still available through the shadow password suite.\n    -

**Risk/Impact**: Warning messages inform users who are attempting to login to the system of their legal status.\n\n22. **Remove OS Information from Login Warning Banners**\n    - **Control Statement**: Unix-based systems have typically displayed information about the OS release and patch level.\n    - **Risk/Impact**: Displaying OS and patch level information in login banners also has the side effect of providing detailed system information to attackers.\n\n23. **System Maintenance**\n    - **Control Statement**: Ensure proper system maintenance practices are followed to optimize system performance.\n    - **Risk/Impact**: Proper planning, risk assessment, and adherence to best practices can help mitigate these risks.\n\n24. **Review User and Group Settings**\n    - **Control Statement**: This section provides guidance on securing aspects of the users and groups.\n    -

(Choice) users shall be granted access to information, data and applications strictly on a \"need to know\" basis.\n- Any change in access privileges shall be carried out only after approved by appropriate personnel, by using a formal documented process.\n- Segregation of duties shall exist between information access requestors, information access approvers and those implementing access changes. Each of these roles is limited to a pre-defined group and only those specifically given the responsibility shall be allowed to either request or approve access.\n- All access changes shall be carried by the respective operations team specifically authorized to carry out such changes. Examples of access changes include: creation of new employee accounts, transfers, terminations, file folder permissions, etc.\n- User access rights to applications and data shall be assigned based on the user role and permissions approved by the respective application administration team.\n- Privilege escalation for any application and data shall be granted only by the application administrator (IT / Technical Team), on receipt of a documented approval from the LOB Head/ RA/ authorized approver of the person requesting access. All access requests shall include the purpose for request of access.\n- In case the authentication and authorization for an application not being authenticated by the centralized active directory, then a separate application administrator shall manage the user management, password management, and privilege management for the application. The application owners shall be responsible for defining and maintaining access control lists for applications and data. They shall ensure that the level of access granted is appropriate to the business requirements.\n- If for any reason, a user’s access rights need to be modified or revoked, the LOB Head shall send the request for the same in writing to the respective application’s owner / Operations team. The team shall then accordingly modify/revoke the access rights.\n- HR shall promptly report all changes (i.e. LOB transfers, termination, job duty changes) in end-user duties or employment status to application operations team and also to the Technology team handling the user IDs of the affected persons. Respective Operations Team and / or Technology team shall then accordingly modify/revoke the access rights.\n- Users shall be required to re-authenticate themselves after a specific period of inactivity. All systems wherever possible shall use inactivity timeout for sensitive applications.\n- All users shall be granted “read” access to all information classified as “public”. Other rights to such information shall be strictly reserved with the owner of such information.\n- Non-employee Internal System IDs – In addition to meeting the above requirements for internal system access, non-employees have additional constraints that must be adhered to by the non- employee. The leader responsible for the non-employee is accountable for all actions taken by the non-employee. All non-employee systems access should be limited to information necessary for specific business purposes and should be in accordance with the requirements set forth in the Non- Employee Access Standards and the contract governing the work.\n- All Choice Equity Broking Pvt. Ltd. (Choice) information systems privileges shall be disabled within 24 hours of receipt of the termination request, unless otherwise it is stated to disable the access on the last day of the employment or any specific day of employment.\n\n**Access Logs**\n- Access logs for critical assets/ infrastructure shall be monitored and reviewed on near real time basis. In case of security breaches, Incident shall be reported to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) as well.\n\n**Managing User IDs**\n- User Ids shall follow a standard naming convention for all computer systems to facilitate user identification. Naming conventions shall cover all end users, contractors, consultants and vendors. Generic IDs shall not be used.\n- Access to information services shall be controlled by using unique user Ids, wherever possible, which shall enable:\n  - individual accountability\n  - permit centralized identification of users\n  - aids in timely control of potential threats\n- The application / system administrators are responsible for identifying inactive accounts and disabling them. If a user account has been inactive for more than 30 days, the application / system administrator shall disable the account after confirmation from the respective LOB Heads. The application / system administrator shall reactivate the account only after receiving a written request from the user and approval regarding the same from his LOB Head.\n- \"Guest\" accounts and other default accounts shall be disabled on all servers.\n\nEach user is personally responsible for the usage of his or her user ID and password.\n\n**Password Management**\nUser authentication refers to the methods by which a user proves his or her identity. All users must be positively identified prior to using any computer or communication system resources. Traditional user authentication consists of a user ID/password.\n\nThe authentication process verifies the identity of a user attempting to access a system. The process uses one or more of three tests to determine if the user is the authorized user. Passwords are confidential information and are the most commonly used security tool in company systems. Each user is responsible for maintaining and protecting the passwords, PINs, and tokens used for system access. As they become available, enhanced authentication methods may be used.\n\nA good password is the best defense against inadvertent or malicious damage to computer programs and company data. If passwords can be easily guessed or viewed, or if there are not sufficient integrity controls, a perpetrator can break into company systems and gain access to the business data. If a legitimate user ID/password is used to gain access, the breach can go undetected long enough for the perpetrator to do damage.\n\nOrganization would promote strong password controls and ensure the controls are updated from time to time as per security recommendations.\n\n- An initial password shall be provided to the users in a secure manner during the user creation process and the system shall be configured to force the users to change the initial password immediately after the first logon.\n- Passwords shall be conveyed to users in a secure manner. Passwords shall never be disclosed through third parties or through unprotected (clear text) electronic mails.\n- Password constraints and account policy shall be enforced for all user and administrative accounts on operating systems, applications, databases and all other information protected by passwords controls. The controls enforced shall be:\n  - Passwords shall be at least eight characters in length\n  - Password shall be a mix of alphabets, numerals and special characters\n  - Password shall not be a part or same as username or user Ids\n  - New password shall not be same as of the previous 4 passwords (Password history)\n  - Passwords shall not be transmitted over the network without encryption\n- Minimum password age shall be 3 days. In Active Directory, at user level, password expiry shall be set to ‘Never Expiry’. Additionally, multi-factor authentication shall be enabled on available accounts. Non-AD integrated application specific password shall continue to have expiry period of 60 days.\n- Users shall not choose passwords, which can be easily guessed such as the user’s name, car registration number, telephone number, birth date etc.\n- Account shall be locked out after 3 consecutive failed access attempts. For unlocking the user account, user may choose the self-service option or contact Service Desk. Positive user identification is mandatory before any account is unlocked by Technology or by an automated system.\n- In case the user has forgotten the password, the user needs to reset the password\n- Password shall be changed immediately if a user suspects that the password is leaked or compromised.\n- All vendor-supplied default passwords (or other alternative access mechanisms) shall be changed before any computer or communications system is used for any Choice Equity Broking Pvt. Ltd. (Choice) business activity beyond initial evaluation in a test environment. These standards apply to passwords associated with end-user user IDs, as well as passwords associated with systems administrator and other privileged user IDs.\n- Locked account shall be automatically unlocked by the system after 30 minutes.\n- Users shall not share their password with anyone, including their reporting supervisors or colleagues.\n- Passwords should not be written down or left in a place where unauthorized persons might discover them.\n- Passwords shall not be stored unencrypted format in system resources.\n- Appropriate procedures shall be put in place for storing and management of administrative passwords for critical information systems.\n- Due to system limitations or business necessity if any of the password or logical access control policy cannot be followed, associated risk should be brought the attention of the management, and exception shall be documented. Compensating controls shall be put in place to mitigate the associated risk.\n\n**Ensuring Logical Security on Laptops and Desktops**\nSecuring Information on Laptops and Desktops\n\n- The folders or disk drives in individual desktops or laptops shall not be shared unless appropriate access controls have been enabled on the folder or the disk drive. Sharing of any information classified as ‘confidential’ is not permitted unless authorized by concerned authority.\n- Prior LOB Head approval shall be required to use any removable devices like floppy drives, CD Writer etc.\n\n**Controlling Privileged User IDs**\nUse of privileged user IDs\n\n- User ids with high-level access privileges (administrators) shall only be used in the event of emergency.\n- System Administrator shall logon using their normal user Id when performing regular work duties rather than logging in as the administrator. Use of Administrator profile shall be limited to administrative activities only.\n- User id’s with privilege access shall be managed with PAM tool.\n- All emergency actions, which bypass normal access control procedures, shall be logged and reported for immediate review by delegated authority.\n\n**Use of Generic IDs**\n- Local logon rights should be disabled for generic system ID’s\n- Generic ID’s should not have system or security administration authority\n- All interactive login methods (FTP, telnet, rexec, SSH, etc.) should be disabled for such user ID’s by either:\n  - Denying access to the user rights: 'Access this computer from network' and 'Logon through Terminal Services' OR\n  - Another method that disables interactive login methods for the given service or protocol\n- If the password for such user ID is hardcoded in a file, the same needs to be encrypted and should not be in clear text.\n- Id owner details should be established so ownership is documented for accountability\n\n**Use of Privileged utility programs**\nSensitive system utilities are the utilities which give unrestricted access to the critical system resources. The sensitive system utilities include but not limited to Format, User addition / deletion / update, Change in Network Settings.\n\n**Restricting Use of System Utilities**\n- Access to system utilities shall be restricted to authorized personnel in accordance with their business functions and needs.\n- All unnecessary sensitive utilities shall be removed / disabled from the system.\n- The use of all system utilities shall be logged and regularly reviewed by the Technology team.\n- It shall be ensured that normal users do not have access rights to use utilities. Any backend update to the data using SQL / similar utilities shall be done only after approval of credential request over email.\n- System utilities shall be separated from application software.",

    "content": "3.1 Key Principles of Secure Development\n\n<!-- section_id: SDP-3.1 -->\n1. **Secure Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**\n   The SDLC for all development types must incorporate security at each phase:\n   - **Requirements Gathering**: Include security requirements from the start and ensure alignment with application security needs.\n   - **Design**: Apply security by design principles to avoid vulnerabilities, such as secure coding practice and architecture reviews.\n   - **Development**: Implement secure coding techniques and conduct security code reviews.\n   - **Testing**: Perform thorough security testing, including static and dynamic analysis including vulnerability scanning and security code review.\n   - **Deployment**: Ensure the security of production environments by conducting final validation.\n   - **Maintenance**: Continuously monitor and patch systems post-deployment to address new vulnerabilities or performance issues.\n\n2. **Application Security Requirements**\n   Application security requirements must be identified and enforced across all platforms and environments. These include:\n   - **Authentication & Access Control**: Use [[control:MFA]]/ Dual-factor authentication and [[control:RBAC]] for all users wherever possible. Enforce least privilege access.\n   - **Data Protection**:\n     - Implement [[control:encryption]] for data in transit and at rest.\n     - Use secure communication protocols.\n     - Implement strict data retention and deletion policies.\n   - **Vulnerability Prevention**:\n     - Protect against common threats such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and buffer overflow attacks.\n     - Implement input validation and output encoding techniques to avoid injection flaws.\n\n3. **Secure System Architecture and Engineering Principles**\n   - **Security by Design**: Integrate security controls and practices during the design phase, not as an afterthought.\n   - **Defense in Depth**: Employ multiple layers of security controls (e.g., [[control:firewalls]], [[control:intrusion detection systems]], [[control:encryption]], etc.).\n   - **Zero Trust Architecture**: Ensure all components authenticate and authorize every request, regardless of source, and encrypt communications at every layer.\n\n4. **Secure Coding Practices**\n   Developers should adhere to secure coding guidelines to prevent vulnerabilities. These include:\n   - **Secure Coding Standards**: Adopt and enforce secure coding guidelines, such as OWASP top ten or other industry best practices (as feasible) to prevent common vulnerabilities.\n   - **Code Reviews**: Conduct regular peer reviews and pair programming.\n   - **Secure Development Tools**: Use integrated development environments (IDEs) and tools that support secure coding practices (e.g., IDE-based vulnerability scanners, linters, Sonar Lint).\n   - **Training**: Provide continuous secure coding education for all developers.\n   - **Prohibited Practices**:\n     - Hard-coding sensitive data like passwords or keys.\n     - Using deprecated or vulnerable libraries or frameworks.\n     - Failing to sanitize input before processing.\n\n5. **Security Testing in Development and Acceptance**\n   - **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: Analyze source code for vulnerabilities before runtime.\n   - **Vulnerability Testing**: Simulate attacks to identify potential security risks.\n\n6. **Outsourced Development**\n   For any outsourced development, the following must be ensured:\n   - Security practices must be in line with organizational standards.\n   - The vendor must provide evidence of secure development practices, including secure coding, testing, and compliance certifications (if any) such as [[external:ISO]] 27001, ISO 12207.\n   - Explicit security clauses must be included in contracts and agreements with third-party developers.\n   - The Information Security team should evaluate that all necessary security requirements of the Choice Equity are met and any exceptions are documented and signoff by [[role:CISO]].\n\n7. **Separation of Development, Test, and Production Environments**\n   - **Environment Segregation**: Maintain clear separation between development and production environments to prevent unauthorized access and data leakage.\n   - **Access Control**: Strictly control access to each environment, with minimal overlap between personnel involved in development, testing, and production.\n   - **Data Handling**: Production data should never be used in testing environments without anonymization or pseudonymization.\n\n8. **Change Management**\n   - **Version Control**: All changes to code and configurations must be tracked using secure version control systems, such as Gitlab.\n   - **Change Approval**: Introduce a formal change approval process to ensure all changes are reviewed from a security perspective before deployment.\n   - **Auditing**: Maintain logs of all changes, who approved them, and when they were made, to enable post-incident analysis if needed.\n\n9. **Test Information**\n   - **Data Integrity**: Ensure that test data cannot be used to access or modify production systems.\n   - **Environment Security**: Ensure that test environments are secured and monitored to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data during testing.\n   - **Testing Constraints**: No real production data should be used in testing unless necessary, and if used, it must be anonymized to protect sensitive information.\n\n10. **Protection of Information Systems During Audit Testing**\n    - **Test Environment Isolation**: During audit testing or assessments, systems being tested should be isolated from the live production environment to prevent accidental disruption.\n    - **Data Privacy and Protection**: Ensure that any sensitive data exposed during audit tests is properly protected using [[control:encryption]] and access control measures.\n    - **Compliance**: All audit tests must adhere to regulatory and compliance requirements concerning data privacy.",

Enforce least privilege access.\n   - **Data Protection**:\n     - Implement encryption for data in transit and at rest.\n     - Use secure communication protocols.\n     - Implement strict data retention and deletion policies.\n   - **Vulnerability Prevention**:\n     - Protect against common threats such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and buffer overflow attacks.\n     - Implement input validation and output encoding techniques to avoid injection flaws.\n\n3. **Secure System Architecture and Engineering Principles**\n   - **Security by Design**: Integrate security controls and practices during the design phase, not as an afterthought.\n   - **Defense in Depth**: Employ multiple layers of security controls (e.g., firewalls, intrusion detection systems, encryption, etc.).\n   - **Zero Trust Architecture**: Ensure all components authenticate and authorize every request, regardless of source, and encrypt communications at every layer.\n\n4. **Secure Coding Practices**\n   Developers should adhere to secure coding guidelines to prevent vulnerabilities. These include:\n   - **Secure Coding Standards**: Adopt and enforce secure coding guidelines, such as OWASP top ten or other industry best practices (as feasible) to prevent common vulnerabilities.\n   - **Code Reviews**: Conduct regular peer reviews and pair programming.\n   - **Secure Development Tools**: Use integrated development environments (IDEs) and tools that support secure coding practices (e.g., IDE-based vulnerability scanners, linters, Sonar Lint).\n   - **Training**: Provide continuous secure coding education for all developers.\n   - **Prohibited Practices**:\n     - Hard-coding sensitive data like passwords or keys.\n     - Using deprecated or vulnerable libraries or frameworks.\n     - Failing to sanitize input before processing.\n\n5. **Security Testing in Development and Acceptance**\n   - **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: Analyze source code for vulnerabilities before runtime.\n   - **Vulnerability Testing**: Simulate attacks to identify potential security risks.\n\n6. **Outsourced Development**\n   For any outsourced development, the following must be ensured:\n   - Security practices must be in line with organizational standards.\n   - The vendor must provide evidence of secure development practices, including secure coding, testing, and compliance certifications (if any) such as ISO 27001, ISO 12207.\n   - Explicit security clauses must be included in contracts and agreements with third-party developers.\n   - The Information Security team should evaluate that all necessary security requirements of the Choice Equity are met and any exceptions are documented and signoff by CISO.\n\n7. **Separation of Development, Test, and Production Environments**\n   - **Environment Segregation**: Maintain clear separation between development and production environments to prevent unauthorized access and data leakage.\n   - **Access Control**: Strictly control access to each environment, with minimal overlap between personnel involved in development, testing, and production.\n   - **Data Handling**: Production data should never be used in testing environments without anonymization or pseudonymization.\n\n8. **Change Management**\n   - **Version Control**: All changes to code and configurations must be tracked using secure version control systems, such as Gitlab.\n   - **Change Approval**: Introduce a formal change approval process to ensure all changes are reviewed from a security perspective before deployment.\n   - **Auditing**: Maintain logs of all changes, who approved them, and when they were made, to enable post-incident analysis if needed.\n\n9. **Test Information**\n   - **Data Integrity**: Ensure that test data cannot be used to access or modify production systems.\n   - **Environment Security**: Ensure that test environments are secured and monitored to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data during testing.\n   - **Testing Constraints**: No real production data should be used in testing unless necessary, and if used, it must be anonymized to protect sensitive information.\n\n10. **Protection of Information Systems During Audit Testing**\n    - **Test Environment Isolation**: During audit testing or assessments, systems being tested should be isolated from the live production environment to prevent accidental disruption.\n    - **Data Privacy and Protection**: Ensure that any sensitive data exposed during audit tests is properly protected using encryption and access control measures.\n    - **Compliance**: All audit tests must adhere to regulatory and compliance requirements concerning data privacy.",
